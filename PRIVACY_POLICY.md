# Privacy and Data Usage Policy

**Last Updated:** [Date]

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to **The International Parent Academy** (Sale4Me Connect). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our mobile application (the "App"). We handle your data securely and in compliance with global standards, including **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation) and **CCPA** (California Consumer Privacy Act).

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Personal Data
We collect personally identifiable information that you voluntarily provide to us when registering, such as:
- Name
- Email address
- Phone number
- Date of Birth
- Location (State/Town)
- Profile Bios and Photographs

### 2.2 Financial Data
We do **not** store your financial information (credit card numbers, bank connections) on our servers. All payments are processed by secure third-party payment processors (e.g., Paystack), and we only retain transaction references for reconciliation.

### 2.3 User Content
We collect content you create or upload, including:
- Chat messages (stored securely in our database)
- Media (photos/videos) uploaded to community albums or verification steps

### 2.4 Device & Offline Data
Our App uses **Hybrid Mobile Technology** (Capacitor & PWA Principles).
- **Offline Storage:** To enable offline functionality, we store strictly necessary data (e.g., cached user profile, recent messages) locally on your device using `IndexedDB` and `LocalStorage`. This data stays on your device and is not accessible to other apps.
- **Device Permissions:** We may request access to your device's **Camera** and **Photo Library** solely for uploading profile pictures or verification documents. You can revoke these permissions at any time in your device settings.

## 3. How We Use Your Information
We use the information we collect to:
- Create and manage your account.
- Facilitate community interactions (chats, pledges, town groups).
- Send you administrative notifications (updates, security alerts).
- Improve user experience and app performance.

## 4. Data Storage and Security

### 4.1 Encryption
- **In Transit:** All data transmitted between the App and our servers is encrypted using **TLS/SSL** (Transport Layer Security) protocols.
- **At Rest:** Your personal data stored in our cloud databases (Supabase) is encrypted at rest.
- **Local Encryption:** Sensitive tokens stored locally on your device are protected using standard operating system security mechanisms.

### 4.2 Data Retention
We retain your personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy or as required by law. You may request deletion of your data at any time.

## 5. Offline Functionality & Sync
When you use the App offline, actions you take (e.g., drafting a message) may be stored locally. Once connectivity is restored, this data is synchronized securely with our servers. We minimize the amount of sensitive data cached locally to strict functional necessities.

## 6. Your Rights (GDPR & CCPA)
Depending on your location, you have the right to:
- **Access:** Request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.
- **Rectification:** Request correction of inaccurate data.
- **Deletion ("Right to be Forgotten"):** Request deletion of your account and personal data.
- **Opt-Out:** Opt-out of non-essential communications.

To exercise these rights, please contact our Data Protection Officer at [Insert Email].

## 7. Children's Privacy
While we are a "Parent Academy," our services are directed to adults (Parents). We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.

## 8. Updates to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
